# EC-response-to-IH-and-SH
EC OSA Network and EC Endothelial Response  Network Cytoscape file: 
Cytoscape protein-protein interaction network for endothelial cell response to
hypoxia was created with differentially expressed genes (DEG). The network comprises
cell-cycle regulation, inflammatory signaling via NF-1κB and response to VEGF
stimulus subnetworks on which SH and IH had distinct activities.
Transcriptomic responses under IH and epinephrine revealed
protein-protein interaction networks emphasizing distinct subnetworks, including
Cytokine-Mediated TNF-1α Signaling via NF-1κB, Wnt/LRP/DKK signaling and cell
cycle regulation.
